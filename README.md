This repository holds the code of out-dated Java-based tools that were previously distributed with the open-source GIS [*Whitebox Geospatial Analysis Tools*](https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-geospatial-analysis-tools). Whitebox GAT has a new native-compiled analysis backend, developed using the Rust programming language, called [*WhiteboxTools*](https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-geospatial-analysis-tools/tree/master/whitebox_tools). The tools in this archive all have equivalent Rust-based tools in the WhiteboxTools repository. The Java-based tools are archived here for anyone who needs the code. Note that the original tools were licenced under the GNU GPL.
